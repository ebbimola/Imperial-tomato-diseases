# Datasheet

## Motivation

- The dataset was created to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images into predetermined categories.
- The dataset and model were created by Ebenezer Badmus.
 
## Composition

- The instances in the dataset represent tomato diseases. 
- Total number of instance per category 10
- There are several missing data in the set, which is related to exhaustive list of the disease category.
- The dataset does not contain any confidentialital.

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
- Data collect through public databases, generated by users, among other methods.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- The data went through the following process normalization, augmentation, annotation, and dealing with missing or corrupt data.
 
## Uses

- Besides image classification, the dataset could potentially be used for tasks like feature extraction, transfer learning, or unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering).
- The possible bias in the data is closely related the tomato species that are not categorized in the data.
- The data pose no risk or privacy issue

## Distribution

- The dataset was curated from the public domain.

## Maintenance

- The dataset will be maintained by Ebenezer Badmus
